If you want a repo that is easy to **understand, demo, fork, and grow into a real AI product**, this is the starting point.

## Why this repo exists

Most "AI starter" repos fail in one of two ways:

- they are too toy-like to use in production
- or too bloated to understand in 10 minutes

`ai-agent-starter` aims for the middle:

- simple enough to launch fast
- structured enough to scale
- public-demo friendly
- ready for agents, MCP, prompts, evals, and deployment

## Why people may star it

- **Clear positioning** — not a random demo, but a reusable agent product foundation
- **Fast fork path** — minimal setup, low cognitive load
- **Built for the current AI stack** — Agent workflows, MCP, prompts, evals, deployment
- **Public-launch friendly** — designed to look good on GitHub from day one

## What you get in v0.1

- TypeScript-first project skeleton
- Minimal runnable entrypoint
- Starter folders for examples and templates
- README structure optimized for public discovery
- A clean base for adding:
  - model providers
  - MCP integrations
  - prompt libraries
  - evaluation flows
  - deployment targets
